1. Extend Veeam Backup to FedNet
Deploy a Veeam Backup Proxy or Veeam Backup Agent in the FedNet environment.

Ensure Veeam is configured to back up FedNet VMs or physical servers.

You can back up to:

FedNet-local storage (faster)

A central backup repository on-prem (for DR)

External storage or Veeam Cloud Connect (for long-term offsite)
